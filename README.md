# word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors

This repository hosts the `word2vec` pre-trained **Google News** corpus (3 billion running words) word vector model (3 million 300-dimension English word vectors). 

It is mirroring the data from the official [word2vec website](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/):  
[GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing)

The motivation was to provide an easy (programmatical) way to download the model file via `git clone` instead of accessing the Google Drive link.

You will need to install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to be able to clone this.
